## Story Template Custom Record Templates

This is documentation for an extension I created for Fantasy Grounds Unity to allow for defining arbitrary record types templates for 
use with story templates.

### What does that... I don't even?

Yeah it's a bit narrow in its applicability. But if you have ever used Story Templates in FGC or FGU, you know that they 
are very flexible when it comes to generating formatted text from tables and such. Great for generating certain types of story 
hooks and other content for FG games.

However, the one limitation that I have always had to work-around with them is that they only output formatted text. You 
can structure that text into tables, chat frames, etc. but you cannot arbitrarily format the story template output into 
campaign records (like NPCs, items, vehicles, etc.)

The purpose of this extension is to create a simple UI to allow you to create templates that will utilize the data generated 
by the existing story templates in order to automate the creation of those records. Allowing you to generate any type of 
campaign record for any FGU ruleset.

### Installation

Like any other Fantasy Grounds extension, just place the ext file in the extensions directory. Or use the forge.
